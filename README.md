# 📝 To-Do Listing Web App

A clean and responsive To-Do / Task Manager web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or incomplete. Tasks can include optional details such as a description, deadline date, and priority level. Data is stored in the browser's **local storage**, so your tasks remain available even after refreshing or closing the browser.
